# DecisionDay


What this project is about and what it aims to accomplish?
This project will analyze and compare the starting salaries of students with the same major; comparing earnings of those who attended college institutions with higher tuition rates vs. those who attended college institutions with lower tuition rates.


Explain the problem that the project addresses specifically.
This project will discredit the perception that higher tuition rates result in higher salaries.


What evidence is there to support the need for this project?
Based upon analysis of historical salary outcome data, attending institutions with higher tuition rates does not evaluate to higher earnings when compared to graduates who attend more economical institutions with the same major.

Salary Increase By Type of College
Party school? Liberal Arts college? State School? You already know your starting salary will be different depending on what type of school you attend. But, increased earning power shows less disparity. Ten years out, graduates of Ivy League schools earned 99% more than they did at graduation. Party school graduates saw an 85% increase. Engineering school graduates fared worst, earning 76% more 10 years out of school. See where your school ranks.
 
Salaries By Region
Attending college in the Midwest leads to the lowest salary both at graduation and at mid-career, according to the PayScale Inc. survey. Graduates of schools in the Northeast and California fared best.
 
Salary Increase By Major
Your parents might have worried when you chose Philosophy or International Relations as a major. But a year-long survey of 1.2 million people with only a bachelor's degree by PayScale Inc. shows that graduates in these subjects earned 103.5% and 97.8% more, respectively, about 10 years post-commencement. Majors that didn't show as much salary growth include Nursing and Information Technology.
